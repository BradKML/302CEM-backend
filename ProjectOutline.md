Today is the 16th December 2019, our **deadline is 3rd Janurary 2020.**  

From today, this gives us **19 days**, and this is going to be interrupted by Christmas and New Year, so I am sure everyone would like to get the project done by 24th December.  

Working as a team, dividing up tasks, sharing information and effectively using Trello, GitHub and Circle CI, I am sure we can get it done.

**REMEMBER: The object of this project is not for us to build a new facebook but to demonstrate how we use GitHub, CircleCI and Trello to plan, create, organize and deliver a product.**
 
### Project TweetScape
 
This is the project I think we should build:  

Using the very simple to understand twitter API, we will create a web app that will track and analyse a twitter account  

It is based on this existing idea https://socialblade.com/twitter/user/realdonaldtrump  

As you can see, we can build a webapp that will collect, analyse and display:
- Follower count
- Following count
- Like count
- Number of tweets
- Creation date

And create a database where we display the change in:
- Follower count
- Following count
- Number of tweets

We need to build a **Frontend** and a **Backend**.

**Frontend** includes:
- Landing page
- User page
- Navigation 
- Diagrams.

**Backend** includes:
- Database
- Twitter API
- Information access
